I am Abraham Hinteregger, currently living in Feldkirch, Austria. As I have recently finished my studies I am looking for an interesting job, either in Vorarlberg or Switzerland. Feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:oerpli@outlook.com) or on [twitter](http://twitter.com/oerpli).

I use this site to (rarely) blog about things I do. 

## Education
I've studied Physics at the University of Vienna (finished in 2017) and Software & Information Engineering and Computational Intelligence at the Vienna University of Technology (switched to the CI Master after 2/3 of my SW Eng. Bachelor). 

For my second Master's thesis in Computational Intelligence I was employed by the [Austrian Institute of Technology](http://ait.ac.at/) to work on Cryptocurrency Analytics.
I've finished my work there in Summer 2018 and will present the results from my research at the  [Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2019](http://fc19.ifca.ai/) conference (a preprint of the short paper will be available shortly on arXiv.org). Some preliminary results can be found on [GitHub/MONitERO](https://github.com/oerpli/MONitERO).

* **Computational Intelligence** (MSc; Vienna University of Technology, only thesis remaining)
	* Thesis: Used a new method to analyze traceability of Monero, evaluated effectiveness against previously published traceability heuristics.
	* Lots of algorithms, in some cases even applied to other stuff (geometry, game theory, LP/IP, graph problems, ...)
	* Machine learning (statistical methods [ElemStatLearn](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), semi-deep (<15 layers) learning)
	* A large amount of logic, theoretical CS & discrete mathematics

* **Physics** (MSc; University of Vienna, finished 11/2017)
	* Thesis: Identified systemically risky companies using the DebtRank method (Battiston, 2012). Submitted to Journal of Financial Stability, preprint available on [arXiv.org/1801.10487](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10487)
	* Computational Physics & Stochastic Processes
	* Complex Systems
	* Electronics
	* Quantum Optics

Most of my exercises are available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/exerCIses/) [^1].
