## Education
 
Since 2014 I'm studying for my two master degrees:

###  **Computational Intelligence** (Vienna University of Technology)
* Algorithms
	* Algorithmic Game Theory
	* Algorithmic geometry
	* Linear/Integer programming
	* Graph based problems (shortest path algorithms, flows, ...)
* Heuristic Optimization
	* Local search, genetic algorithms, Ant colony optimization, tabu search, VNS/VDS/VLNS
* Theoretical CS
	* Proof theory
	* Computability theory
	* Complexity theory & analysis
	* Nonclassical logics (temporal, dynamic epistemic, ...)
* Machine Learning
	* Deep Learning (using keras)
	* SOMs
	* Classification & Discriminant Analysis (similar to [ElemStatLearn](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)) 

###   **Physics** (University of Vienna)
* Computational Physics
* Complex Systems
* Electronics
* Quantom Optics
* Stochastic Processes

Most of my exercises are available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/exerCIses/) [^1].

[^1]: Currently changed to private per request of a professor (similar exercises in winter term 2014 and 2015).

I plan to finish my regular courses in both studies in the winter term 2016 and write my thesis for Physics in 2016 and my thesis in Computational Intelligence in spring/early summer of 2017. 

### Undergraduate stuff

*   Physics (BSc): 2010 - 2014
*   Software & Information Engineering[^2]: 2012 - 2014

[^2]: Finished approx. 110ECTS - I then got the chance to switch to the Computational Intelligence master's studies which i did gladly.

In Physics I chose "Computational Physics", "Bio Physics" and "Theoretical Physics III: Electrodynamics" as elective courses.

I wrote my bachelor's thesis in the laboratory "Scientific Computing" under the supervision of Sabine Andergassen - the topic was "Sampling the Ising Model" and was about different approaches to sample the Ising Model using single spin and cluster flip algorithms.

I later rewrote the simulation from my bachelor's thesis in C# with a better GUI for the [Campus Festival 2015](https://www.univie.ac.at/650/aktuelles-ueberblick/campus-festival-2015/) (650 year anniversary festival of the University of Vienna) where it was showcased as interactive nucleation simulation (pictured below). The source code and binaries are available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/Ising/releases)
