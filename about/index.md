This is the blog of Abraham Hinteregger, a physics & computer science student living in Vienna, Austria.
You can contact me via [mail](mailto:oerpli@outlook.com) or on [facebook](http://fb.com/oerpli).


I use this site to (rarely) post about things I do. 

# Things I do

I enjoy (in no particular order):

* Some "sports" ([Chess](http://de.lichess.org/@/oerpli), [Cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12093854), [Sailing]({% post_url 2017-04-19-fb2-yachting-licence %}), Skiing)
* Dark Souls
* C#, Haskell
* A few shows
	* Fargo
	* Curb Your Enthusiasm
	* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Bullet Lists
* Camembert

Apart from that I'm mainly studying.

## Education
 
Since 2014 I've been studying for my two master degrees:

* **Computational Intelligence** (Vienna University of Technology)
	* Algorithms applied to all kinds of stuff (geometry, game theory, LP/IP, graph problems, ...)
	* Machine Learning (statistical methods similar to [ElemStatLearn](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) & deep learning)
	* Theoretical Computer Science

* **Physics** (University of Vienna)
	* Computational Physics & Stochastic Processes
	* Complex Systems
	* Electronics
	* Quantom Optics

Most of my exercises are available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/exerCIses/) [^1].

[^1]: Currently changed to private per request of a professor (similar exercises in winter term 2014 and 2015).

I finished my regular courses in both studies in the winter term 2016. Currently I'm writing my thesis in Physics about systemic risk in the Austrian economy.
Furthermore I'm looking for internship opportunities where I could write my master's thesis in CS. Topics that interest me are:

* Machine Learning
* Quantitative Finance
* Artifical Intelligence
* Cryptography
* (relational) Databases

#### Theme
This website is built with Jekyll. I use the Moon theme from Taylan TatlÄ± which can be found [here](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon)
