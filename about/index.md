I am Abraham Hinteregger, currently a student living in Vienna, Austria.
You can contact me via [mail](mailto:oerpli@outlook.com) or on [twitter](http://twitter.com/oerpli).

I use this site to (rarely) post about things I do. 

Here some bullet lists:

## Education
I've studied Physics at the University of Vienna (finished in 2017) and Software & Information Engineering (switched to a Master's program after ~2/3) as well as Computational Intelligence.

For my second Master's thesis I will work at the [AIT](http://ait.ac.at/) on Cryptocurrency Analytics. This should be done by the end of Summer 2018.

* **Computational Intelligence** (MSc; Vienna University of Technology, only thesis remaining)
	* Lots of Algorithms, sometimes applied to stuff (geometry, game theory, LP/IP, graph problems, ...)
	* Machine Learning (statistical methods [ElemStatLearn](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), (somewhat-)deep learning)
	* Theoretical Computer Science & discrete mathematics

* **Physics** (MSc; University of Vienna, finished 11/2017)
	* Thesis: Identified systemically risky companies using the DebtRank method (Battiston, 2012). Submitted to Journal of Financial Stability, preprint available on [arXiv.org/1801.10487](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10487)
	* Computational Physics & Stochastic Processes
	* Complex Systems
	* Electronics
	* Quantom Optics
