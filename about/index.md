This is the blog of Abraham Hinteregger, a physics & computer science student living in Vienna, Austria.
You can contact me via [mail](mailto:oerpli@outlook.com) or on [facebook](http://fb.com/oerpli).


This site <del>is currently under construction</del> will (maybe) be constructed one day.


## Education
 
Since 2014 I'm studying for my two master degrees:

*   **Physics** (University of Vienna)
*   **Computational Intelligence** (Vienna University of Technology)

Most of my exercises are available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/exerCIses/) [^1].

[^1]: Currently changed to private per request of a professor (similar exercises in winter term 2014 and 2015).


I plan to finish my regular courses in both studies in the winter term <del>2015</del> 2016 and write my thesis for Physics in early 2016 and my thesis in Computational Intelligence in <del>autumn 2016</del> spring 2017. 
The topics are not decided yet but I'm leaning towards something economy related in Physics. My other thesis will most likely be related to something from the Algorithms and Complexity or from the Logic & Computability module.

### Undergraduate stuff

*   Physics (BSc): 2010 - 2014
*   Software & Information Engineering[^2]: 2012 - 2014

[^2]: Finished approx. 110ECTS - I then got the chance to switch to the Computational Intelligence master's studies which i did gladly.

In Physics I chose "Computational Physics", "Bio Physics" and "Theoretical Physics III: Electrodynamics" as elective courses.

I wrote my bachelor's thesis in the laboratory "Scientific Computing" under the supervision of Sabine Andergassen - the topic was "Sampling the Ising Model" and was about different approaches to sample the Ising Model using single spin and cluster flip algorithms.

I later rewrote the simulation from my bachelor's thesis in C# with a better GUI for the [Campus Festival 2015](https://www.univie.ac.at/650/aktuelles-ueberblick/campus-festival-2015/) (650 year anniversary festival of the University of Vienna) where it was showcased as interactive nucleation simulation. The source code and binaries are available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/Ising/releases)
