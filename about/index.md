I am Abraham Hinteregger, currently living in Feldkirch, Austria. I work as a Data Scientist in at oerlikon Balzers. Feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:oerpli@outlook.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/oerpli).

I use this site to (rarely) blog about things I do. 

## Education
I've studied Physics at the University of Vienna (finished in 2017) and Software & Information Engineering and Computational Intelligence at the Vienna University of Technology (switched to the CI Master after 2/3 of my SW Eng. Bachelor). 

For my second Master's thesis in Computational Intelligence I was employed by the [Austrian Institute of Technology](http://ait.ac.at/) to work on Cryptocurrency Analytics.
I've finished my work there in Summer 2018 and presented the results from my thesis at the  [Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2019](http://fc19.ifca.ai/) conference in St. Kitts. The preprint of the conference paper can be found on [arXiv.org/1812.02808](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02808). Sourcecode, data and results can be found on [GitHub/oerpli/MONitERO](https://github.com/oerpli/MONitERO).


### What did I do during my studies

* **Publications**:
	* 1st Thesis: Identified systemically risky companies using the DebtRank method (Battiston, 2012) ([Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/10/792)/[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10487)).
    * 2nd Thesis: Used a new method that incorporates information from currency forks to trace Monero transactions; evaluated effectiveness against previously published traceability heuristics ([Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02808))
    * Journal Paper: [Forensic analysis of Turkish elections in 2017–2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204975). My contributions for this paper were marginal (data curation & software).

* **Computational Intelligence** (MSc; Vienna University of Technology, only thesis remaining)
	* Lots of algorithms, in some cases even applied to other stuff (geometry, game theory, LP/IP, graph problems, ...)
	* Machine learning (statistical methods [ElemStatLearn](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), semi-deep (<15 layers) learning)
	* A large amount of logic, theoretical CS & discrete mathematics
    * A few courses on programming language paradigms (e.g. stack based, functional, constraint based) and theory (e.g. theory of type systems).

* **Physics** (MSc; University of Vienna, finished 11/2017)
	* Computational Physics & Stochastic Processes
	* Complex Systems
	* Electronics
	* Quantum Optics
