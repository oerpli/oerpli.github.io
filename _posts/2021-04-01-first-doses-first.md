# Introduction

In the current stage of the pandemic, vaccines are worth their weight in gold (and then some, gold is not that expensive and the vaccines not that heavy).
Particularly in ~~Europe~~ the EU, there are currently shortages due to a failed procurement strategy. 
To make at least some lemonade from the lemons we were given, it is paramount to efficiently distribute the vaccines to maximize their impact.

On idea which has been successfully adopted by several regions (UK, Quebec and others) is to give as many people as possible a first dose of the vaccination,
as even a single dose is enough to prevent severe cases of COVID (more about this can be found [here]({% post_url 2021-04-01-efficacy-1d-2d %})).

The basic argument boils down to this:
- One dose of the vaccination reduces symptomatic cases by >85%
- Two doses reduce symptomatic cases by >90% (the exact numbers differ between the vaccinations and age groups, but this is roughly what they are)
- Assume that you have 2 doses - you can either give one to your grandmother and one to your grandfather or both of them to your grandmother
  - In the first case, you prevent that both of them die but they might get a mild cough (with 15% chance).
  - In the other case you reduce the chance that granny gets a cough by another 10% but you let your grandfather die (or at least wait a few months with a raging pandemic until it's his turn to get vaccinated).

# Acknowledgements

My work is primarily inspired by [Alex Tabarrok](https://twitter.com/ATabarrok) and [Zvi Mowshowitz](thezvi.wordpress.com). While I recommend reading their output in general, I particularly recommend their writing on COVID as it is miles and months ahead of most newspapers.

Furthermore I want to thank Zvi & the anonymous donor that sponsored the [COVID microgrants](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2021/03/04/covid-3-4-declare-victory-and-leave-home/) that made this work possible.
