# Acknowledgements

My work is primarily inspired by [Alex Tabarrok](https://twitter.com/ATabarrok) and [Zvi Mowshowitz](thezvi.wordpress.com). While I recommend reading their output in general, I particularly recommend their writing on COVID as it is miles and months ahead of most newspapers.

Furthermore I want to thank Zvi & the anonymous donor that sponsored the [COVID microgrants](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2021/03/04/covid-3-4-declare-victory-and-leave-home/) that made this work possible.
