# DLVC Exam questions

The exam questions for the course "Deep Learning for Visual Computing" are available [here](https://github.com/cpra/dlvc2016/).

I tried to add some structure to this and tried to provide answers for the questions.

Latex sources available on [github](https://github.com/oerpli/dlvc/tree/master/questions)

PDF (March 2017) available [here](https://github.com/oerpli/oerpli.github.io/blob/master/pdfs/DLVCQuestions.pdf)

Feel free to open a PR if you find errors or want to add something.
