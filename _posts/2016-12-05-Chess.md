It's now possible to embed lichess games (any amount) at the front of the post with the post type. I tried to implement it with a custom tag like `{chess game_id}` but I think this is not supported by gh pages. 

Now it works the following way:

Add this to the front matter (the cryptic stuff is the game id from a lichess game (the part between .org and /black: https://en.lichess.org/tNTJjdFB/black )

    games:
	- ZfLDSzYr
    - tNTJjdFB 
	
It just works.
