# The FB2 License

For people that want to charter a yacht for their holidays without a skipper this is usually the recommended licence. It allows to handle boats:

* with a length of up to 78 feet
* worldwide 
* up to 20 nautical miles from the coast

# Theoretical exam

The exam consists of a multiple choice part as well as a navigation exercise. The workload is approximately 10:90 so keep this in mind when preparing. For the MC part I made some index cards that can be used with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

## Theory: Navigation part

I recommend to brush up on basic geometry and physics and learn the meaning of the symbols in a map.
Working with a pair of compasses and a set square (?) on a nautical map should also be trained until you're able to do it quickly and precisely.

## Theory: MC Part

### How to setup Anki:

* Download your version from the official homepage: [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
* Install and start the program
* Install the [Multiple Choice extension](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/379383283) by copy pasting the code `379383283` in Tools → Addons → Browse & Install field
* Download the Index cards. Depending on the association the questions may differ. I recommend to download and learn both sets provided here[^1]:
	* [Seefahrts Verband Süd (SFVS)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1323657053)
	* [Motorbootsport u. Seefahrts Verband Österreich (MSVM)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1585804710)
* Open the downloaded files with Anki

[^1]: Anki deletes decks that are not used frequently so the links above may not work when you need them. Contact me on Twitter if this is the case and I will upload them somewhere else as soon as possible[^2]

[^2]: It may happen that I am on a yacht somewhere in the carribean sea when you need to cram for your exam - I recommend starting early enough.


### Errors

If you notice any errors you can drop me a mail or contact me on Twitter. The questions are exported from the PDFs provided on the homepages of the associations and parsed with some regular expressions. Some mistakes may have happened in the process. I used the most up to date versions available in April 2017.
