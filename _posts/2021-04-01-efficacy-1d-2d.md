# Introduction

People think that the Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19 only protects against the illness after the second shot has been administered. 
When looking at the data from the phase 3 trial, this is obviously wrong.
In this post I will try to clarify some of these misunderstandings as easy as possible.

The following picture is the relevant plot from the publication[^1]. The two curves (blue & red) show the COVID-19 incidence in the placebo (blue) and treatment (red) groups.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oerpli/oerpli.github.io/master/img/days_after_d1.png)

If the vaccine doesn't work, one would expect both lines to have a similar slope.
If it works, the slope of the treatment group will be less steep than that of the placebo group. 
Efficacy is calculated as the fraction of the gradients of the two slopes.

This means: If the placebo group rises by 10 units per day and the vaccine group rises by 2 units per day, this translates to a 80% efficacy (as a group that would have had 10 infections without vaccine only has 2 infections, a reduction of 80%).


The table below the plot shows the efficacy of various time-intervals:

- After dose 1 (day 0 to the end): 82%
- After dose 1 and before dose 2 (day 0 to 21): 52.4%
- Dose 2 to 7 days after dose 2 (day 21 to 28): 90.5%
- More than 7 days after dose 2 (day 28 to the end): 94.8%

One would think that second and third/fourth of these numbers correspond to the efficacy of 1 dose vs 2 doses but this is wrong because it neglects how vaccinations work as well as the incubation period.

# The incubation period
If a person is exposed to the virus on day X, it takes a few days (4-5, up to a week) until this person gets sick.
More importantly, even a PCR test wouldn't register the virus directly after exposure.
An antigen test would detect it a few days after exposure. 

Therefore it's safe to assume that people that those that tested positive in the first days after dose 1 were already infected before they were vaccinated.

# How vaccinations work
A vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce protection against some virus.
As this process takes some time when a person gets infected with e.g. the flu (approx. 1 week afaik) it's safe to assume that it also takes some time when the immune system is triggered with a vaccine and not a real live virus. I have no idea how long exactly it would take as I am not familiar with these processes, but it's not necessary to guess, as the data from the trial actually shows it. 

If you look at the red and blue curves right after the injection, they follow a very similar trajectory until day 10-12 (the red one is slightly below the blue one even earlier but this is likely random noise).

From then one, there is a gap between the curves that gets continuously larger.

# How would one calculate the efficacy then? 
The same arguments as above also apply to the second dose. 
People that receive the 2nd dose on day 21 and test positive on day 23 were likely already infected before receiving the 2nd dose. 
People that test positive on day 26 might have been infected after receiving the second dose but it's likely that their immune system didn't yet fully react to the second stimulation, meaning their level of protection against a severe case of COVID-19 (if it exists) is still from the first dose. 


Therefore, it's likely better to look at the slope between days 14 and 28 to get the efficacy of the first dose and at day 28 and later for the efficacy of both shots. 

I used the professional medical data analysis tool MS Paintâ„¢ to remove the first ~10 days and put some slopes in there to estimate the efficacy of one dose (green line) and two doses (purple line).

The result can be seen here:

# What does it mean? 

- The green line is already way less steep than the blue one, i.e. the first dose is likely already enough to prevent spread symptomatic cases (afaik there wasn't a severe case of COVID in the population vaccinated with 1 dose after the initial period where the vaccine isn't effective yet during any of the vaccine trials)
- The purple line is slightly less steep than the green one, but compared to the blue one this increase is marginal. Data from the NHS says that the increase in immunity from the 2nd dose is approx 1/15th of the increase of the first dose (89% vs 95%)[^2] 

# What should we do with this information?

Put pressure on the politicians & bureaucrats that waste 50% of doses on people that are already >80% immune and use it for persons that are still 0% immune.
Keith A Moyse from Oxford[^3] has calculated the optimal vaccination strategy taking these things into account, basically it is:
- Give people N to N+5 years old one dose (starting with old people)
- Give people in the brackets 15 years below the first dose
- Then give the old people the second dose



# What are other things that should be considered?

Most commonly I've heard about immune escape and long time protection.

## Immune escape
I don't want to get very into the details of this argument, as its proponents never fail to not do so either.
Basically, the idea is that there might be a higher chance for immune escape if a lot of people only have partial protection from the vaccine and the virus might evolve to circumvent the immunity conferred by the  vaccine.
This argument is stupid for several reasons:
- It's known that the immune system of old people is weaker than that of young people. If less than 100% protection is something VERY BAD THAT WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT, why do we vaccinate old people despite a higher chance that they (on average) will be only 92% or 93% immune and not 100%? There is no magical threshold just at the average immunity conferred by the 2nd dose of BNT162b2, else we would also ban less effective vaccinations (such as J&J, AZ)
- If in one scenario 50% of the population is 95% immune and the other half is 0% immune, there is way more viral activity (reproduction, spread, mutation...) than in a scenario where 100% of the population is 89% immune. More viral activity implies more mutations and a theory that prefers the first scenario over the second has to have a lot of epicycles.
- The mutations we're currently worried about arose before there were serious vaccinations programs.
- It's safe to assume that countries with more chaotic management (civil wars, natural disasters, being France) will fuck up scheduling the second dose for at least some parts of the population.
If this results in immune escape, we will get that anyway at some point, so why let hundreds of thousands of people die from wasting 50% of the vaccinations if we will have to figure out how to deal with variants anyway?

## Long time protection
One common argument is that "there's no evidence that the protection from one dose lasts for long enough".
To this I would respond that there is also no evidence that the earth doesn't crash into the sun if I don't punch people in the face that bring up that argument. 

The more serious counter arguments are:
- Reinfection with COVID-19 is rare
- Protection from other vaccines doesn't run out a few weeks after administering them. There's no reason to assume that COVID-19 is a super-magic-mega-bad illness that defies all expectations and works completely different
- Even if immunity would vanish after 6 or 8 weeks (this is a pretty big if), it would still be better to vaccinate people 3 and 4 and 5 times as the production ramps up, because the increased availability in later months more than makes up for loss of doses from needing more on each individual.
  - Let's take the following scenario, you have 10 doses in Jan, 20 in Feb, 40 in March, 80 in April, 160 in May, ...
  - You could vaccinate 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 people with 2 doses. Total of 155.
  - Or, with only 1 dose, refreshed after 2 months: 10, 20, 30 (40 doses in March, 30 first time vaccinations, 10 "wasted" to refresh those from January), 60, 120 (160 doses, 120 first time, 40 to revaccinate everyone from March, including those that already had one in January). Total of 240.
  - At some point (when enough people are vaccinated or the ramp up of production capacity slows down) it will be better to switch over to 2 doses in 1 month and be done with it but currently we're far away from that point.
  - A table can be found in the Addendum



Therefore, I would conclude that people talking about those two risks are mostly just parroting what other people were saying without having spent a few minutes seriously thinking about it as it doesn't hold up to  basic scrutiny. If anyone has counter arguments, feel free to direct me to them, my contact information is available on the main page of this blog.


# What about other vaccines (Moderna, AZ, Sputnik,...)
The same reasoning with slightly different numbers also applies to the Moderna and AZ vaccines. Their papers don't have a plot that is as nice as the one from the Biontech paper, therefore I used that one for this post.
