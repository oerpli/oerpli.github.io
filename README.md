# My blog/website/whatever

I'm using the Moon Jekyll theme from @TaylanTatli with a few modifications. Feel free to fork this repo if you like my modifications.

## Modifications

* Faster animations here and there
* Navigation pane has a bigger max height
* Home thingy is a little bit bigger
* Added the possibility to add your [lichess](http://lichess.org/) account in the style of the other social buttons
* Changed the logos of the social button to something a little more lightweight
* Added menus with subcategories (only up to depth one)
* Changed the posts/all posts/all tags navigation point to use the newly implemented dynamic system instead of hardcoding the levels
